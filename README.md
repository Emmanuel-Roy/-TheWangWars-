# FireEmblemTheWangWars
This project was made as a class project in tribute to our great teacher Mr. Wang. The project was made in FEBUILDER since it was super easy to use!

This project was made by Korman Item (Character Art and Box Art.), Emmanuel Roy(Logic design, programming and debugging), Samhith Komatreddy and Samarth Kabbur(Debugging and Map design).

How to play
1. Dump a real Fire Emblem Sacred Stones Cartridge and save the .gba file to your computer
2. Download an IPS patcher, download the latest release from the github, and patch the rom.
3. Voila, either use an emulator, GBA flashcart, or the 3DS GBA rom injector to play the game.
