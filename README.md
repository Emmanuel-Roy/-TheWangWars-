# WangProject
This project is literally a project I am doing in school.
All of the assests and custom sprites I use are available to you but you need to give me credit when applicable.
This project is meant to show my skills with graphical design and less with coding, this project will not use any code.
However this project will still require a foundation in graphic design and some creativity.
If you want to make anything like this I will be documenting my steps in this readme file.

Step One: Aquire a FE7 rom or any other GBA Fire Emblem rom file
Step Two: Download an emulator and the FE_Builder application.
Step Three: Create some assets for usage
Step four: Be sure to import your assets and rip the old ones from the game.
